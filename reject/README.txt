Rejected code!
==============

Files in here are mostly experiments that didn't make it for some reason.
Either it didn't work out, wasn't up to my quality standards, or just not
a good idea to do it that way.
You're actively discouraged from using this code for anything, but feel free to
draw your own conclusions or ask me questions.

Warning: May have unfixed bugs. I don't care.

If you end up using some of this code despite all warnings and actually fix
a glaring bug, please submit a PR so that others won't run into the same issues.

Each snippet may be accompanied by an extra text file with a bit of rambling
why it was rejected.
